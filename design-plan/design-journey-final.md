# Project 3, Final Submission: Design Journey

> **Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)
>
> Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.
>
> Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.
>
> **Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Milestone 1 Feedback Revisions
> Explain what you revised in response to the Milestone 1 feedback (1-2 sentences)
> If you didn't make any revisions, explain why.

I received a perfect score on Milestone 1, so no revisions were necessary. My planning for both the modal and hamburger menu interactivity was thorough and met all requirements.

## Interactivity Usability Justification
> Explain how the interactivity _functionally_ improves the user's experience and helps them accomplish their goals. (i.e. Your interactivity does _more_ than add additional clicks; the interactivity doesn't insert additional barriers for the user when working towards their goals.)
> Explain how your interactivity's design effectively uses affordances, visibility, feedback, and familiarity.
> Write a paragraph (3-4 sentences)

The portfolio project modal improves user experience by allowing visitors to view detailed project information without navigating away from the main portfolio page, which helps maintain the browsing context and reduces the cognitive load of having to return to previous content. The hamburger menu improves the mobile experience by conserving important screen space while still providing full navigation access with minimal effort. It uses familiar icons and animations that provide immediate visual feedback. Both interactive elements use clear affordances (clickable thumbnails for the modal and the universally recognized hamburger icon) and visibility principles (darkened overlay for the modal and animated transitions for the menu) to ensure users intuitively understand how to interact with the website.


## Tell Us What to Grade
> We aren't re-grading your entire Project 1 or 2.
> We are only grading the interactivity you added to the project.
> Tell us where (what pages) we can find your interactivity and how to use it.
> **We will only grade what you list here;** if it's not listed here, we won't grade it. **No exceptions.**

You can find interactivity implemented on these following pages:

    1. All html pages (specificaly navigation):
      - Hamburger Menu: On narrow screens, a hamburger icon will replace the nav menu in the top right corner to open a full-screen menu.
      - Close Menu: You can click on the “×” icon or outside the menu to close it.

    2. portfolio.html:
       - Case Study Modals: If you click on any case study thumbnail in the “Marketing & Product Design Case Studies” section, a modal will open up with additional content and images.
       - Close Modal: You can click on the “×” icon or outside the modal area to close it.

These interactive elements are written in "interactivity.js" using jQuery and styled with responsive, and accessible CSS transitions in "site.css".

## Self-Reflection
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved from Project 1? What would you do differently next time? (2-3 sentences)

Through this assignment, I've learned how to create effective client-side interactivity that enhances rather than complicates the user experience. From Project 1 to now, I've grown from creating static websites to developing dynamic, responsive interfaces that adapt to user needs. If I were to do this again, I would spend more time exploring more complex interactions and animations to further enhance the user experience.

> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments! (1-3 sentences)

Since starting this class, I've progressed from basic HTML structures to creating fully responsive websites with meaningful interactive elements. I've developed a deeper understanding of the relationship between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and how they work together to create engaging user experiences. I'm proud of my ability to not just code a website, but to design thoughtful interactions that truly serve the user's needs.
