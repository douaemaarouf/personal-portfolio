# Project 3, Final Submission: Design Journey

> **Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)
>
> Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.
>
> Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.
>
> **Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Milestone 1 Feedback Revisions
> Explain what you revised in response to the Milestone 1 feedback (1-2 sentences)
> If you didn't make any revisions, explain why.

TODO: milestone 1 feedback revisions


## Interactivity Usability Justification
> Explain how the interactivity _functionally_ improves the user's experience and helps them accomplish their goals. (i.e. Your interactivity does _more_ than add additional clicks; the interactivity doesn't insert additional barriers for the user when working towards their goals.)
> Explain how your interactivity's design effectively uses affordances, visibility, feedback, and familiarity.
> Write a paragraph (3-4 sentences)

TODO: interactivity rationale


## Tell Us What to Grade
> We aren't re-grading your entire Project 1 or 2.
> We are only grading the interactivity you added to the project.
> Tell us where (what pages) we can find your interactivity and how to use it.
> **We will only grade what you list here;** if it's not listed here, we won't grade it. **No exceptions.**

TODO: what should we grade


## Self-Reflection
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved from Project 1? What would you do differently next time? (2-3 sentences)

TODO: reflection


> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments! (1-3 sentences)
