# Project 3, Milestone 1: Design Journey

> **Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)
>
> Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.
>
> Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.
>
> **Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Project
> Which project will you add interactivity to enhance the site's functionality?

Project (TODO: 1 or 2)


## Audience's Goals
> List the audience's goals that you identified in Project 1 or 2.
> Simply list each goal. No need to include the "Design Ideas and Choices", etc.
> You may adjust the goals if necessary.

- TODO: goal 1
- TODO: goal 2
- TODO: ...


## Modal Interactivity Brainstorm
> Using the audience goals you identified, brainstorm possible options for **modal** interactivity to enhance the functionality of the site while also assisting the audience with their goals.
> Briefly explain each idea and provide a brief rationale for how the interactivity enhances the site's functionality for the audience. (1 sentence)
> Note: You may find it easier to sketch for brainstorming. That's fine too. Do whatever you need to do to explore your ideas.

- TODO: idea 1
- TODO: idea 2
- TODO: ...


## Interactivity Design Ideation
> Explore the possible design solutions for the interactivity.
> Sketch at least two iterations of the modal and at least two iterations of the hamburger menu interactivity.
> Annotate each sketch explaining what happens when a user takes an action. (e.g. When user clicks this, something else appears.)
> Do not include HTML/CSS annotations in your sketches!

TODO: design sketches


## Final Interactivity Design Sketches
> Create _polished_ design sketch(es) (it's still a sketch, but with a little more care taken to communicate ideas clearly to the graders) to plan your interactivity.
> **Sketch out the entire page where your interactivity will go.**
> Include your interactivity to the sketch(es).
> Add annotations to explain what happens when the user takes an action.
> Include as many sketches as necessary to communicate your design (ask yourself, could another 1300 take these sketches an implement my design?)

**Modal design sketches:**

TODO: final design sketch(es)

**Hamburger drop-down navigation menu design sketches:**

TODO: final design sketch(es)


## Interactivity Rationale
> Describe the purpose of your proposed interactivity.
> Provide a brief rationale explaining how your proposed interactivity addresses the goals of your site's audience.
> This should be about a paragraph. (2-3 sentences)

TODO: design rationale


## Interactivity Planning Sketches
> Produce planning sketches that include all the details another 1300 student would need to implement your interactivity design.
> Your planning sketches should include _all_ HTML elements needed for the interactivity; _annotations_ for the element types, their unique IDs, and CSS classes; and lastly the initial CSS classes.
> This is asking you to create a planning sketch like the one we did during the in-class activity.

**Modal planning sketches:**

TODO: planning sketch(es)

**Hamburger drop-down navigation menu planning sketches:**

TODO: planning sketch(es)


## Interactivity Pseudocode Plan
> Write your interactivity pseudocode plan here.
> Pseudocode is not JavaScript. Do not put JavaScript code here.

**Modal pseudocode:**

> Pseudocode to open the modal:

```
TODO: pseudocode
```

> Pseudocode to close the modal:

```
TODO: pseudocode
```

**Hamburger menu pseudocode:**

> Pseudocode to show/hide (toggle) the navigation menu (narrow screens) when the hamburger button is clicked:

```
when the hamburger button is clicked:
  if the navigation menu is not visible:
    TODO: pseudocode
  else:
    TODO: pseudocode
```

> Media queries are prohibited to show/hide the hamburger menu for this assignment.
> (I want you to demonstrate the interactivity learning objectives we covered in class.)
> If the browser window is narrow when the page loads, the hamburger button should be visible and the navigation should be hidden.
> If the browser window is wide when the page loads, the hamburger menu should not be visible.
> Complete the pseudocode to show/hide (toggle) the navigation on page load:

```
on page load (ready):
  if window is narrow:
    TODO: pseudocode
   else if window is wide:
     TODO: pseudocode
```

> If the browser window is resized from wide to narrow, the hamburger menu should become visible and the navigation should be hidden.
> If the browser window is resized from narrow to wide, the hamburger menu should become hidden and the navigation should be visible.

```
on window resize:
  if window is narrow:
    TODO: pseudocode
  else if window is wide:
    TODO: pseudocode
```
