# Personal Portfolio: Interactive Website Enhancements

This repository showcases **my personal portfolio project** where I focused on elevating a static website with interactive features. It demonstrates my ability to create responsive, user-centered designs that combine visual polish with accessible interactivity.

**Key Features:**
- Responsive hamburger navigation menu for mobile users
- Modal pop-ups to highlight important content
- Smooth transitions and user-friendly design
- Clean, modular HTML/CSS/JavaScript structure

This project reflects my growth as a creative technologist and strategist- blending thoughtful design with purposeful interactivity.

## üè´ Project Origins

This project began as part of an assignment for INFO 1300 at Cornell University, where I was tasked with adding interactive elements (hamburger menu, modal) to an existing site. I followed the assignment‚Äôs requirements to ensure best practices in accessibility and responsive design.

However, I‚Äôve since refined and polished the project to align with my personal aesthetic and professional standards. All code and design decisions reflect my own work and vision.
