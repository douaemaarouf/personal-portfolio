## Project 3 Submission

Stage, commit and push **all** changed files in your Git repository to the GitHub server. (All commits should reside on the _main_ branch.)

Complete the [submission form](https://cornell.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4MIEbRGMW4wTFDo) for each project 3 milestone to submit the assignment.

**Note:** The submission form asks you to check your submission. **Checking your work will ensure you receive credit for this assignment.** We ask you to check your submission because this is where some students lose points. It's easy to forget something and checking your work prevents the heartache of getting a 0 because your submission wasn't submitted in a way that we can access and grade it.
