            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Douaeâ€”a sophomore at Cornell University studying Information Science and Communication. Why? Because I'm endlessly curious about how technology shapes human behavior, and how we can unlock the holy grail of storytelling that actually sticks.</p>

            <p>ðŸ’¡ I'm all about finding the sweet spot where brand strategy, communication technologies, and human interaction come together. Whether it's geeking out over marketing trends, analyzing fascinating data patterns, or designing unforgettable user experiences, I'm on a mission to craft digital experiences that are as functional as they are fun to use.</p>

            <p>ðŸŒ± But here's the thing: none of this works without people. Community is everything to me. Whether I'm collaborating with a team, making products more accessible, or amplifying someone else's voice, I'm driven by the idea that every brand, every design, every campaign should create meaningful connections. Because at the end of the day, that's what it's all about: building raw, authentic, and deeply human connections in an increasingly tech-driven world.</p>

            <p>ðŸ«§ When I'm not dreaming up creative strategies, you can find me hiking scenic trails, learning from locals in other countries, or losing track of time reading psych thrillers with my cat purring in my lap. Oh, and I have a thing for photography too ðŸ‘€</p>

            <aside>
                <p>Fun fact: I started taking travel photography more seriously after spending a weekend camping in the Sahara Desert. BEST EXPERIENCE EVER!!</p>
